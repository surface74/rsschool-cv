### Code example:
**Create a function taking a positive integer as its parameter and returning a string containing the Roman Numeral representation of that integer**
Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero. In Roman numerals 1990 is rendered: 1000=M, 900=CM, 90=XC; resulting in MCMXC. 2008 is written as 2000=MM, 8=VIII; or MMVIII. 1666 uses each Roman symbol in descending order: MDCLXVI.
 
```
const solution = num => {
    const dec = [900,500,400,100,90,50,40,10,9,5,4,1];
    const rom = ['CM','D','CD','C','XC','L','XL','X','IX','V','IV','I'];

    let result = '';
    if (num >= 1000) {
        result = 'M'.repeat(num / 1000);
        num %= 1000;
    }
    return dec.reduce((result, item, i) => {
        while (num >= item) {
            result +=rom[i];
            num -= item;
        }
        return result;
    }, result);
};
